\usage{
filter_metadata(filter_list = list(), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{filter_list}{a named list of variables to filter metadata on. See
details for valid field names.}

\item{...}{additional value combinations to filter on. See details for

}
\value{

}
\description{

\details{
List of valid field names:
\itemize{
  \item{new_name: the new, standardized variable name}
  \item{old_name: the original variable name from older files}
  \item{type: variable type. Options are binary (bin), continuous (cont),
   unordered categorical (uc), ordered categorical (oc), and string (string)}
  \item{warning: flags for issues}
  \item{group: group number (matches the same questions across surveys)}
  \item{q_group_N: number of variables that are in the group}
  \item{topic1: indicates specific content topic (e.g.
   medication or housing status), there is no hierarchy between topic1 and
   topic2}
  \item{topic2: indicates specific content topic (e.g.

   topic2}
  \item{source: source of variable}
  \item{respondent: respondent, either the person interviewed or

  \item{wave: the wave of data collection associated with the variable}

  \item{section: section of survey where question is asked}
  \item{leaf: the rest of the variable name}
  \item{q_group_list: a string that lists all of the new variable names
